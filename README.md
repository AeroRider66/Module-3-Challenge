## Application Purpose
This appliction is designed 


Combination of multiple 'while' loops with the employee into a single 'while' - idea and most of implementation from Samuel Wlodawski

I got a lot of understanding of the logical coding on the conditional while input loop from Samuel Wlodawski.  He showed my how we could do an iterative input from the user, and build the employee array from that.

Samuel Wlodawski explained about the array passing salary on as a string.
